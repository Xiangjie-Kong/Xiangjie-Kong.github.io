Kong is an undergraduate student in School of Computer Science and Technology / Faculty of Innovation Engineering at Macau University of Science and Technology (M.U.S.T. 澳門科技大學). 

Research status
======
Kong is currently an undergraduate student in the Phase Field-Computational Fluids team led by [Prof. Yang Junxiang](https://cfdyang521.github.io/) from the School of Innovative Engineering, Macau University of Science and Technology. His research interests include **3D Volume Reconstruction** and **Scientific Computing**.

Research Outcome
======
Here's my latest research.
